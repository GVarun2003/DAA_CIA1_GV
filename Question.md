The Question. 
solve the directed, negative weighted graph, using the matrix

[[0,4,2,0,0],[0,0,3,2,3],[0,1,0,4,5],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,-5]] (the weights)

the expected output: It returns None if shortest path from source to all other nodes can be arbitrarily low (ideally tends to -inf) because of negative cycles.
Otherwise the array of shortest distances from source to all other nodes is returned.

the output observed: NONE (since a negative cycle is observed)
