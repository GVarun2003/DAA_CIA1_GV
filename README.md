Bellman-Ford Algorithm for solving the question 

Reason for choosing Python: the language i am most comfortable using is python.

Reason for choosing Bellman-Ford algorithm and not the remaining 3 algorithms(Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's):  Prim's and Kruskal's algo. wont work in negative, directed graphs. Dijkstra's algo doesn't work in negative weighted graphs. (since a cycle wont be formed, and if at all formed, will give a wrong conclusion).
however, bellman-ford works on all the said conditions. thus this is my choice.
